# Basic Navigation Exercise

This exercise helps practice the most common navigation keymaps in your Neovim setup.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Vim motions (hjkl, w, b, etc.)
- Understanding of your custom keymaps for file/buffer navigation

## Exercise 1: File Navigation

**Goal**: Practice efficiently navigating between files in your project

1. Open any file in your project
2. Use `gsf` to search for and open another file in the project
3. Use `gsF` to search for and open a file outside the current project
4. Return to the original file using your preferred method

## Exercise 2: Buffer Search

**Goal**: Practice searching within buffers effectively

1. Open a file with significant content (preferably something you're familiar with)
2. Use `gsc` to search for a specific term in the file
3. Navigate to at least 3 different occurrences of search terms
4. Use `gs;` to navigate between headings in the file
5. Return to your original position

**Success Metrics**:
- Find each target in under 5 seconds
- Maintain context awareness while navigating

## Exercise 3: Combined Navigation

**Goal**: Practice a realistic workflow combining multiple navigation techniques

1. Use `l os` to open your scratch2023 file
2. Use `gs;` to find a specific heading
3. Use `gsc` to find content related to a keymapping you want to explore
4. Use `gsf` to find the implementation of that keymapping
5. Use keyboard shortcuts to split the window and view both files
6. Navigate back to the scratch file without using the mouse

**Success Metrics**:
- Complete the entire workflow in under 30 seconds
- Maintain a clear mental model of where you are at each step

## Notes
- Record areas where you hesitate or struggle
- Note any keymaps you find yourself wanting but don't currently have
- Consider keymaps that could be optimized for your usage patterns

## Next Steps
- Modify any keymaps that felt awkward during the exercises
- Create additional keymaps for operations you found yourself needing
