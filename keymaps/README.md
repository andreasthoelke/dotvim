# Neovim Keymap System

This directory contains documentation and training materials for my Neovim keymap system.

## Overview

My keymap system is designed around:
- Ergonomic efficiency
- Mnemonic consistency
- Workflow optimization

## Directory Structure

- `ergonomics.md` - Principles and guidelines for keymap ergonomics
- `categories.md` - Organized inventory of keymaps by functional category
- `exercises/` - Training exercises to practice and internalize keymaps

## Development Process

The keymap system is continuously evolving based on:
1. New workflow needs
2. Ergonomic optimizations
3. Consistency improvements

## Usage

- Refer to `categories.md` for a comprehensive reference of available keymaps
- Use exercises in `exercises/` directory to practice and internalize keymaps
- Review `ergonomics.md` when designing new keymaps to ensure they follow established principles

## Future Plans

- Complete keymap inventory
- Develop more specialized exercises
- Create visualizations of keymap usage patterns
- Implement automated keymap analysis tools
