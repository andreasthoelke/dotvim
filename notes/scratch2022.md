## Nvim Tree

l no   - toggle nvim-tree open
l nf   - find current buffer in tree
b      - set base/root dir
B      - show only open paths!
<>     - sibling moves
P      - parent node

  can not have different roots in different tabs/wins


## vim DBUI
:DBUI  needs to :DBUIFindBuffer of a .sql file
`gei` evaluates paragraphs
initially the DB is empty. you first need to create data with ->
localhost:8080/docs
try -> execute to create party, then vote and find the person, vote and party in the DB!

# new git workflow
leader ogs    - lines changed per file! via git diff HEAD --stat
leader ogd    - git status with delta diffs <tab> to stage/unstage
leader ogc    - git commit message via fugitive (use ,,w to save and close/ confirm commit)
leader oga    - stage all & commit message via fugitive
leader ogl/L  - list of git commits (with date ago/telescope)

- checkout older version of file out under a different name
- put windows of different file versions side by side and use
:set scrollbind
:set noscrollbind

### Telescope git_bcommits
This is a convienient alternative approach to see a diff via VimDiff in 
two vim buffers side by side:
Telescope git_bcommits    - Run this in the file/buffer you want to compare
                          - find the commit/version you want to compare compare compare to
                          - use <c-t> to open a new tab with two VimDiff buffers!
                          - use :q on the 'Original' buffer to close the tab!


*  - previous line start
c-o - any non-reversible jump should use "normal! m'" to add to the jump list

## end of block motion
J  - when at the beginning of the block, can just use the indent level motions
leader)  - this jumps to the end of the block from any place inside the block. (reversible via c-o)

[op]ii  - inside indent block (linewise delete, change, yank)
[op]ai  - outer indent block (linewise delete, change, yank)

leader od  - open dirvish in float!

,,sr  - search in repo (previously leader gsr)
,,sr :call SearchRepo( GetInputStr('Search in repo: ') )<cr>
,,sR :call SearchRepo( "â”€.*" . GetInputStr('Search in repo: ') )<cr>
,,<leader>sr :call SearchRepo( "\/\/.*" . GetInputStr('Search in repo: ') )<cr>
also:
leader fg - and then can use regex like //.*List to search in comments

### Telescope project maps
d	delete currently selected project
r	rename currently selected project
c	create a project*
s	search inside files within your project
b	browse inside files within your project
w	change to the selected project's directory without opening it
R	find a recently opened file within your project
f	find a file within your project (same as <CR>)
Default mappings (insert mode):
Key	Description
<c-d>	delete currently selected project
<c-v>	rename currently selected project
<c-a>	create a project*
<c-s>	search inside files within your project
<c-b>	browse inside files within your project
<c-l>	change to the selected project's directory without opening it
<c-r>	find a recently opened file within your project

type Tags
are just arrays on Posts .. not connections

use the Comment implement (not the node) version
the add a custom Node type to the interface [Node]

i might make manually unique string ids in data.ts.
