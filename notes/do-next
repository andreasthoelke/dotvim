search and sel a git working dir (open divish folder and set lcd)
note that ctrlp has a directory selector using c-f in the window.

all maps/ commands into fzf and qucklist supprt

revisit my process for applying commands to paths



# Syc & show: Run terminal command and show result in float-win
- return result of command to float win. example 'ls -a'
Async launch: Launch an app/service. Pass params, no return vals, no interaction
- vs code, mpv
- ytdl, youtube-dl  - they should notify when done. but may take a long time to finish. and there may be a list. - progress indicator in terminal
Interactive:
- node repl

# Input param: (visible in menu)
a single path, url or strings
- vis sel
- from cursor to end of line

# Commands:
i'll list all commands (including tricky options).
most commands will only have one useful mode - syc with return, asyn (with progress or without),
interactive - so this will be encoded in the menu option

# Shell execution
i can put a list of filepaths in a scratchbuffer and :setf dirvish
the i can collect into the arglist ('x' in dirvish) can collect arguments
then i'd do :Shdo! cp {} {}-bk to get:
cp 'test2' 'test2'-bk
cp 'vimdump-map.txt' 'vimdump-map.txt'-bk

i could use linescollector to add to a buffer of file paths
tryout :2Shdo of a selection of paths

ls ~/Documents/tests/YT-dls/
