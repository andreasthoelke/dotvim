https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/


Old attemps bak:
Now using vcsh at ~/.config/vcsh/repo.d/vim.git/ to git-version control config files
Alternative: :! config  - to interact with git version control of dotfiles in ~/.cfg see: /Users/at/.zshrc#/#%20using%20'config' 
Run git commands, e.g.:
vcsh vim config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
vcsh vim status

## Video
We now have 'mpv -h' and 'vlc -h' installed!
 -> test these!

:e %mynewfile - this creates a new buffer in the current Dirvish folder!
gp <c-o>v   - browse-open recent file in a split e.g. from a different project

## Dirvish
t           - open in new tab
leader of   - open file under cursor in float-win. curson is in float win so you can scroll right away.
P           - preview in float-win
p           - preview in (currently open?) split. only good if there is no other open split?
:e %mynewfile - this creates a new buffer in the current Dirvish folder!
g?          - show help
K           - file info/ dir size/ last write
.           - on a file, then 'rm' or 'mv %..' to delete, more file.

T           - expands a the folder under the cursor.

### Ranger-like setup
"Win navigate right to left and use 'p'"

c-w v c-w = - make 3 columns
c-w |       - go to the next 'last window', then c-w h/l, then 'p' to fill the previous win with the content of the node
TODO some simple maps/commands for 'p' could achieve a basic ranger functionality!?

### Filepaths Urls
c-w f       - (on filepath) preview file content in horz-split
leader of   - open filepath under cursor in float win

            leader oa   - show arglist in CtrlP. v/t to open. <c-s> to delete

### Move / Copy files
manual/low level:
  yy in Dirvish - copy the full file path
  navigate to the destination path in Dirvish then `glT` to open a terminal at that location
  mv or cp ("cp -r" to copy a folder) then <c-[> to go to normal mode then `p` to paste then insert and `.` to copy/move into current folder
assisted:
  - put two dirvish folders side by side. use e.g. \T\v
  - the win/folderpath that has the cursor is the source (other on is the target of the move) (left/right does not matter)
  - add files to the arglist (highlighted in red). use ,x(l/}/vis-sel)
    - reset arglist with leader X
    - show arglist with leader oa (CtrlPArgs)
  - run the shell command with leader mv
  - alternatively preview/edit the command with leader mV

Note we are using pyenv: /Users/at/.zshrc#/#%20Use%20pyenv
and: alias python=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 to use the most current homebrew installed python 3 version as whenever 'python' is called
You can install Python packages with pip3 install <package> They will install into the site-package directory /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.9/site-packages

reload shell settings with 'exec $0' or 'source ~/.zshrc'
'which'/'type -a' <shell-cmd>   - shows info about a shell command

lead lead ls   - uses ShellReturn() to show the result of 'ls'  ~/.vim/plugin/tools-external.vim#/func.%20ShellReturn.%20cmd


### Terminal buffer
