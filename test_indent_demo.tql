# TypeQL Indentation Demo


# When you type "match" and press Enter, the next line will be indented:
match
$p isa person;
$p has name "John";
$p has age 30;

one
two
three


Lets focus on just this file ftplugin/typeql.vim
and write TypeQLIndent()

I want a paragraph based logic:
the first line of a paragraph should have no indention.
the second and all following lines should have a 2 spaces indention.

given the examples lines below TypeQLIndent() should produce the "Intented formatting".

Current formatting:

one1
  two three
  four

one2
  two three
  four

Intended formatting:

one1
  two three
  four

one2
  two three
  four
