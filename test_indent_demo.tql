# TypeQL Indentation Demo


# When you type "match" and press Enter, the next line will be indented:
match
  $p isa person;
  $p has name "John";
  $p has age 30;

one
  two
  three


Lets focus on just this file ftplugin/typeql.vim
  and write TypeQLIndent()

I want a paragraph based logic:
  the first line of a paragraph should have no indention.
  the second and all following lines should have a 2 spaces indention.

given the examples lines below TypeQLIndent() should produce the "Intented formatting".


Wrong. Only the "match" lines and the first line should have no indent. all other lines in the paragraph should still be indented

When a comment line is not the first lines of a paragraph, then that comment lines should have no effect of the
  indentation of the following lines.

Current formatting:

# a comment
  two three;
  four five

match
  two three;
  # comment
  four five

Intended formatting:

# a comment
  two three;
  four five

match
  two three;
  # comment
  four five



one1
  two three
  four
match
  two three
  four

one2
  two three
  four

Intended formatting:

one1
  two three
  four
match
  two three
  four

one2
  two three
  four
