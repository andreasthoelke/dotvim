# TypeQL Indentation Demo
# This file demonstrates the fixed indentation behavior

# When you type "match" and press Enter, the next line will be indented:
match
  $p isa person;
  $p has name "John";
  $p has age 30;

# The indentation is maintained after semicolons and commas:
define
  person sub entity,
    owns name,
    owns age,
    plays friendship:friend;
  
  friendship sub relation,
    relates friend;

# Complex queries maintain proper indentation:
match
  $p isa person,
    has name $n,
    has age $a;
  $a > 20;
  $f (friend: $p, friend: $p2) isa friendship;
fetch
  $p: name, age;

# Rules with when/then blocks:
rule
  when
    $p isa person;
    $p has age $a;
    $a > 65;
  then
    $p has category "senior";
